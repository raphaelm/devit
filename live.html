            <p><p>How can we design for the promise of the future AND build for the reality of today, all while in an Agile environment? Cheryl Platz turns her experience designing for products like Azure and Alexa into survival strategies for products at the cutting edge. From information architecture and accessibility to emerging tech like AI and conversational UI - we'll take a whirlwind tour to build a roadmap for "opti-pessimistic" product design.</p></p>

We'll spend some time with the open source Apache OpenWhisk serverless platform implementing a few example use cases.

            <p><p>It’s hard to be a developer and not have heard of Xamarin. It’s now part of Microsoft’s ‘Any developer, any platform’ strategy, and allows you to write C# and F# code that runs on iOS and Android. Combined with the power of the cloud, you can easily build the mobile apps of tomorrow that your users will love. In fact, we are so sure you are going to love Xamarin we're going to teach you how build an app to share photos of happy Xamarin developers. </p><p>This workshop will take you from 0 to a fully working, cloud connected, AI powered mobile app. We'll get you setup with Visual Studio and the Xamarin tooling on either Windows or Mac, and connect up your iPhone or Android device to Xamarin Live Player ready to run an app. Once you are set up we'll cover the basics of Xamarin and Xamarin.Forms, then it's heads down writing a cross-platform app - using one code base for a fully-native app that runs on both iOS and Android.</p><p>The app we build will combine accessing device hardware using Xamarin plugins, AI for face and emotion detection and cloud services like authentication and blob storage, all built using a serverless architecture. Finally we'll go from code to production ready, using Visual Studio App Center to build your app, monitor for crashes, gather analytics, and prepare you app for distribution. We'll even look at wiring up push notifications so your app can be notified when someone else uploads a photo. </p><p>By the end of the day you will have a production ready, AI and cloud powered mobile app.</p></p>

By the end of this talk you’ll have the tools to create and maintain a scalable UI codebase, spiced with the sweet taste of nostalgia.</p></p>

            <p><p>Getting code into production can have consequences beyond just making your customers happy.  It can wake people up in the middle of the night, bring down the datastores, be a cost nightmare, and remind you ‘imposter syndrome’ is a real thing. But more importantly, it can break trust , create frustrations, and burn people out. </p><p>So what happens when a full-stack engineer joins an operational team and goes to war with operational risks? Are there more skills to be gained besides cool war stories and scars after each incident?</p></p>
